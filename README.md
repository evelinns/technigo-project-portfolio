# Portfolio

- Project to showcase work completed during the bootcamp as well as side projects I've had from before.
- I worked off a design option available through technigo and then worked on one section at the time, finishing it with the tablet and mobile versions
- It's built to be responsive across devices

If I had more time I'd sort the Skill section to pull information from the data file and setup the relevant logic to sort in the different areas. I'd also complete more testing on different screensizes and actual devices to ensure it behaves as I want.
